Each \verb|\section| corresponds to the scope of one member's assignment,
and each \verb|\subsection| corresponds to one theorem or exercise in the textbook,
specified in the format $m.n$
where $m$ is the section number and $n$ is the theorem/exercise number.
If $n$ is not given, we use $n = 1$ instead.
\section{Toga (2022/09/19)}
\subsection{Exercise 1.1}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[(a)] Since addition is commutative, $0 + \alpha = \alpha + 0$ holds.
    We also have $\alpha + 0 = \alpha$ by definition,
    hence $0 + \alpha = \alpha$.
\end{itemize}
